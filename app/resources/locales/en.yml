helpText: "An <b>L-system</b> or <b>Lindenmayer system</b> is a parallel rewriting system and a type of formal grammar. 
An L-system consists of an alphabet of symbols that can be used to make strings, a collection of production rules 
that expand each symbol into some larger string of symbols, an initial 'axiom' string from which to begin construction, 
and a mechanism for translating the generated strings into geometric structures.
